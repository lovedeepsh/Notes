Steps to setup Jenkins X
------------------------

- First you will need to get the jx command line tool locally on your machine.
- You can use the jx command line to create a new kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed automatically.
- If you already have an existing kubernetes cluster then install Jenkins X on your kubernetes cluster.
- When you have a kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed, check out your next steps.

Step 1 :- Get 'jx'
```
curl -L https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/download/v1.3.80/jx-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xzv
sudo mv jx /usr/local/bin
```

Step 2 :- Create new cluster on any of platform you choose (NOTE - Installing on kubernetes already created cluster contains different steps)
```
jx create cluster gke --skip-login  --default-admin-password=******** -n mycluster
```
Step 3:- Install Jenkins X on Kubernetes Cluster
- Jenkins X can be installed on 1.8 or later of Kubernetes.
- Recquirements are :-
```
1. RBAC is enabled
2. Insecure docker registries are enabled. This is so that pipelines can use a docker registry running inside the kubernetes cluster (which typically is not public so no https support). You can modify your pipelines to use other registries later.
3. A cluster with at least 4 vCpus in addition to the master node (e.g. 2 m4.large nodes + m4.large master)
```
- To enable RBAC you need to create a namespace using the command below
```
# kubectl create namespace opstree-123
[NOTE:- namespace name should use lowercase letters with numbers including]
```
- To grant a role or cluster role [RBAC] to a user named "XYZ" in namespace "ABC"
```
kubectl create rolebinding bob-admin-binding --clusterrole=admin --user=lovedeeps789 --namespace=opstree-123
```
